Between seasons, Arsenal has about the same level of success. However, Nott'm Forest has a much improved performance in both home and away games from the 2023-24 season to the 2024-25 season.")


st.header("2) Do Red Cards Cost Teams Wins?")
st.write("After exploring team performance across seasons and in both home/away teams, we can narrow down on exploring match-specific factors that may contribute to the pattern of wins. We examine whether teams that accumulate more red cards tend to win less over the 2024-25 season. Brush over teams in the bar chart to highlight their win trajectories.")

st.write("Now that we have explored the lack of a strong relationship between frequency of red cards and team performance across a season, we can further examine the factors that actually contribute the the frequency of red cards at a match-specific level. Here, we look at how referees differ in the penalties they award, and whether fouls and cards are more extreme in specific matches. Brush referees on the left, then click a match point to see its penalty breakdown by team within that match.")

    st.write("Though some referees have higher average penalties (both fouls & cards), the extreme points with high fouls and cards don't have a large imbalance in which team (home versus away) are being given these penalties. Generally, there is an equal distribution of penalties between the teams for high foul + high card matches.")
